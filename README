Thinkfan is a simple, lightweight fan control program. Originally designed
specifically for IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads, it now supports any kind of system via
the sysfs hwmon interface (/sys/class/hwmon). It is designed to eat as little
CPU power as possible.



WARNING!!!!
===========

There's only very basic sanity checking on the configuration (semantic
plausibility). You can set the temperature limits as insane as you like.

Any change to fan behaviour that results in higher temperatures in some parts
of the system will shorten your system's lifetime and/or cause weird hardware
bugs that'll make you pull out your hair.

   No warranties whatsoever.

If this program steals your car, kills your horse, smokes your dope or pees
on your carpet...
 - too bad, you're on your own.




Building and installing
=======================

For Debian Squeeze (testing) create /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf with: 

`options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1`

and install the package thinkfan

1. In the thinkfan main directory, do
    mkdir build && cd build

2. Then configure your build, either interactively:
    ccmake ..

   Or set your build options from the command line. E.g. to configure a build
   with full debugging support:
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug .

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING can also be "Release", which produces a fully
   optimized binary, or "RelWithDebInfo", which is also optimized but can
   still be debugged with gdb.
   
   Other options are:

   USE_NVML:BOOL (default: ON)
       Allows thinkfan to read GPU temperatures from the proprietary nVidia
       driver. The interface library is loaded dynamically, so it does not
       need to be installed when compiling.

   USE_ATASMART:BOOL (default: OFF)
       Enable libatasmart to read temperatures directly from hard disks. Use
       this only when you really need it, since libatasmart is unreasonably
       CPU-intensive.


3. To compile simply run:
    make

4. If you did not change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, thinkfan will be installed
   under /usr/local by doing:
    make install

   CMake will detect whether you use OpenRC or systemd and install some
   appropriate service files. With systemd, you can edit the commandline
   arguments of the thinkfan service with `systemctl edit thinkfan`.
   With OpenRC, we install only a plain initscript (edit /etc/init.d/thinkfan
   to change options).
